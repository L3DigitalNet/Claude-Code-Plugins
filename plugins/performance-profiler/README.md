## Planned Features

- **MCP server benchmarking** — measure tool call latency, throughput, and resource usage for any running MCP server
- **Flamegraph generation** — produce visual call-stack profiles from Node.js and Python MCP servers
- **Regression tracking** — compare performance across plugin versions and flag regressions automatically
- **Claude context cost analysis** — estimate token usage per tool call to identify high-cost tools

## Known Issues

- **Not yet implemented** — this plugin is a placeholder; no tools or commands are available yet
