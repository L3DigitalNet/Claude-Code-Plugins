  Guided design document authoring workflow with intensive principles
  discovery. Use when starting a new design document, when a project
  lacks formal design documentation, or when asked to "help design",
  "write a design doc", "document this system", or "figure out our
  design principles". Should be suggested before /design-review when
  no existing document is present. Output feeds directly into
  /design-review.

This skill runs the Design Document Authoring Protocol — a guided
interview process that extracts project context, discovers and stress-tests
design principles, resolves principle tensions, and generates a structured
design document ready for /design-review.

When invoked automatically (not via slash command), respond:
"It looks like you're starting a design from scratch (or don't have a
formal design document yet). I can guide you through a structured authoring
process — it starts with discovering your design principles before writing
any architecture. Type /design-draft to begin, or give me a project name
or brief description and I'll start immediately."
