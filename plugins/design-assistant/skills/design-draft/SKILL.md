This skill runs the Design Document Authoring Protocol — a guided
interview process that extracts project context, discovers and stress-tests
design principles, resolves principle tensions, and generates a structured
design document ready for /design-review.

When invoked automatically (not via slash command), respond:
"It looks like you're starting a design from scratch (or don't have a
formal design document yet). I can guide you through a structured authoring
process — it starts with discovering your design principles before writing
any architecture. Type /design-draft to begin, or give me a project name
or brief description and I'll start immediately."
