Read `.claude/skills/MARKDOWN_TIGHTEN.md` in full.

Ask the user which markdown file to tighten. If they provide a directory, list the markdown files within it and ask them to confirm which ones to process. Process one file at a time in the order the user specifies.

Execute the five-step process as specified for each file. Do not skip steps or write changes without explicit approval at each checkpoint.
