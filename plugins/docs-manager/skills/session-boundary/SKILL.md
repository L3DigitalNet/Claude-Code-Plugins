name: session-boundary
description: Reminds about queued documentation items at session boundaries. Use when the user says "wrap up", "I'm done", "let's commit", "end of session", "push and close", or otherwise signals they are finishing work for the day.
---

When wrapping up a session, check the docs-manager queue:

1. Run `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/queue-read.sh --count`
2. If count > 0: remind the user about pending documentation items
   - "There are N queued documentation items. Run `/docs queue review` to review them before ending the session."
3. If count = 0: stay silent

This skill complements the Stop hook — the hook fires mechanically at session end, while this skill fires when Claude detects session-boundary intent in the conversation (e.g., "let's wrap up", "I'm done for today", "commit and push").
